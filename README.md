# NeuronetiX Machine Learning Internship
This repository contains the completed tasks from the NeuronetiX Machine Learning Virtual Internship, where I explored both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with model evaluation methods. Each task focuses on key machine learning concepts, demonstrated through real-world applications.

## Task 1: Regression
In this task, I implemented different types of regression models:

- Simple Linear Regression: Predicting a target variable based on one feature.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Using multiple features to predict the target.
- Polynomial Regression: Fitting a polynomial function to capture non-linear relationships.

## Task 2: Classification
This task focused on building classification models to categorize data:

- Binary and Multiclass Classification: Implementing classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors.
- Handling Imbalanced Datasets: Techniques to improve model performance with imbalanced classes.


## Task 3: Evaluation for Regression and Classification
Here, I evaluated the performance of regression and classification models:

- Regression Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
- Classification Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and AUC-ROC.

## Task 4: Unsupervised Learning
In this task, I explored clustering algorithms to find patterns in data without labeled outputs:

- K-Means Clustering: Grouping data points into distinct clusters.
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering: Building a hierarchy of clusters for deeper insights.

## Task 5: Model Comparison (Supervised and Unsupervised)
For this final task, I created and compared two supervised and two unsupervised learning models:

- Supervised Learning Models: Built two models using techniques like Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Unsupervised Learning Models: Compared clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
