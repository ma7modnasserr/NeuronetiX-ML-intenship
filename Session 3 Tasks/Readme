## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a student will graduate, drop out, or remain enrolled based on their features. We use machine learning models and evaluate their performance on a variety of metrics including Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and AUC-ROC.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `student_dropout.csv`, containing student records with features like:

- Marital Status
- Application Mode
- Course
- Mother's Qualification
- Father's Qualification
- Target: `Graduate`, `Dropout`, or `Enrolled`

The target variable is mapped to:
- `0`: Graduate
- `1`: Dropout
- `2`: Enrolled

## Modeling and Evaluation

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, map target labels, and select features based on their correlation with the target.
2. **Train-Validation-Test Split**: Split the data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Apply `StandardScaler` to normalize the feature values.
4. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate three classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. **Cross-Validation**: Perform 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to evaluate model stability.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Compute and compare the following metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - ROC-AUC (for binary classification)

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

The models are evaluated using accuracy, MAE, MSE, and ROC-AUC. Based on the evaluation, the best model can be chosen for further tuning or deployment.

Example results (for validation set):

Model	                  Accuracy	MAE	MSE	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	        0.85	0.12	0.15	0.92
Random Forest	              0.87	0.10	0.13	0.94
SVM	                        0.84	0.14	0.16	0.91
